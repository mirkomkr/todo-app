# My To-do List App 📝

This is a simple To-do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed ✅, and filter between all, completed ✅, or pending tasks ⏳.  
The app stores the tasks in `localStorage` so that they persist even after refreshing the page. 🌐

As a junior front-end developer, I created this beginner-friendly demo project to practice and improve my skills with core web technologies.  
This project helped me understand the fundamentals of front-end development and gain hands-on experience in building a functional web app. 💡
