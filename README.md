# My Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and filter between all, completed, or pending tasks.  
The app stores the tasks in localStorage so that they persist even after refreshing the page.  

As a junior front-end developer, I created this beginner-friendly demo project to practice and improve my skills with core web technologies. 
This project helped me understand the fundamentals of front-end development and gain hands-on experience in building a functional web app.

## Features
- Add new tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Filter tasks by: All, Completed, and To Do.
- Data persistence using localStorage.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling with responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality to add, toggle, remove, and filter tasks.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Add tasks using the input field.
4. Click on tasks to toggle their completion status.
5. Use the filter buttons to view all tasks, completed tasks, or pending tasks.

## Demo

## Future Improvements
- Implement task editing functionality.
- Add a feature to save completed tasks separately.
- Support for task due dates.
